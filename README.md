# This document explains how this web API works in detail.

## Configure project and dependencies.

Make sure that you have Node.js and npm installed.
Check out the comments in the "server.js" file first.

1. Create a directory in your machine and cd into that directory.

2. Open command line and run "npm init -y" to create and set up a Node.js project.

3. Run "npm install express shortid" to install Express.js (back-end framework for web APIs) and shortid package for id generation.

4. Create a new js file in the directory named "server.js".

5. Copy the entire code from my "server.js" file into your newly created "server.js" file.

6. Refer to the comments in the "server.js" file to understand the functionalities.

7. Go to command line and run "node server.js" to start the server. You will see a message in the console indicating that the server is live on port 3000.

8. Go to your web browser and navigate to the URL: http://localhost:3000/shorten to get the server rendered components.

9. Here you will see a simple input text and a submit button that creates a shorter version of the URL specified in the textfield.

10. Go ahead and enter a URL, for example, https://www.quantbe.com/welcome/canada/logs/validate , and hit ENTER or click on the Shorten button.

11. This will make an API call using POST method to the endpoint '/shorten', where a shorter version of the original URL is created using an encrypted ID.

12. You will see that the shortened URL is sent back along with the unique encrypted ID, which is generated using an algorithm.

13. Clicking on the shortened URL will redirect you to the content of the original URL, but via the newly shorter generated URL.

14. To see it in action more clearly, copy the shortened ID shown below the shortened URL (this is your new endpoint), and replace the '/shorten' endpoint
    in your localhost URL with `/<your new ID>`. For example, 'http://localhost:3000/shorten' --> 'http://localhost:3000/k7yBBI'.

15. Here, you can see that this shortened URL indeed redirects you to the original URL, let's say https://www.quantbe.com/welcome/canada/logs/validate and
    you can see the content of this page.

16. Empty or null URL inputs will be caught and an error message will appear.

17. Invalid URL inputs will generate invalid shortened URLs and if you try to access that URL, an error message will show.

## CI/CD pipeline configuration and deployment plans.

1. Version Control System (VCS):
   Use a VCS like Git to manage your project's source code.
   Host the repository on a platform like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
   Deploy the server on platforms like AWS or Firebase.

2. CI/CD Platform Selection:
   Choose a CI/CD platform that suits your needs. Some popular choices include Travis CI, CircleCI, Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, and GitHub Actions.

3. CI Pipeline Configuration:
   Create a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files and directories from version control.
   Configure a CI script or configuration file (e.g., .travis.yml, .circleci/config.yml, .gitlab-ci.yml, or GitHub Actions workflow) in your repository for the CI pipeline.
   Define build and test steps within the CI configuration to automate code validation, testing, and building Docker images if applicable.
   Set up environment variables for sensitive data (e.g., API keys, database credentials) in the CI/CD platform's settings or using encrypted secrets.

4. Automated Testing:
   Implement unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests for your web API.
   Configure the CI pipeline to run tests automatically upon code changes.
   Ensure that your CI/CD platform reports test results, code coverage, and quality metrics.

5. Containerization (Optional):
   If you intend to use containerization, create a Dockerfile to package your application into a container image.
   Set up Docker Hub, Amazon ECR, or another container registry to store your Docker images.

6. CD Pipeline Configuration:
   Define the CD pipeline to deploy your web API to a staging environment upon successful CI testing.
   Configure deployment scripts or workflows to deploy your application to a cloud platform or server.
   Implement a deployment strategy (e.g., rolling updates) that minimizes downtime during deployments.

7. Staging Environment:
   Set up a staging environment that mirrors your production environment for testing purposes.
   Configure environment-specific variables or configuration files for your staging environment.

8. Manual Testing (Staging):
   After deploying to the staging environment, conduct manual testing to ensure the API functions as expected.

9. Approval and Promotion:
   Implement an approval mechanism for promoting changes from the staging environment to the production environment.
   Use a manual approval step or an automatic promotion process, depending on your requirements.

10. Production Deployment:
    Configure the CD pipeline to deploy your web API to the production environment after approval.
    Implement rollback procedures in case of issues during production deployment.

11. Monitoring and Logging:
    Set up monitoring tools and configure alerts for monitoring the health and performance of your web API in production.
    Implement centralized logging to gather and analyze application logs.

12. Post-Deployment Tasks:
    Implement automated database migrations and updates, if applicable.
    Perform security scanning and vulnerability assessments on your production environment.

13. Documentation:
    Maintain clear and up-to-date documentation for your CI/CD pipeline and deployment procedures.
    Include instructions for onboarding new team members and troubleshooting common issues.

14. Review and Iteration:
    Regularly review and improve your CI/CD pipeline, testing, and deployment processes based on feedback and lessons learned.

## Possible improvements for real production service.

1. Lack of Authentication and Authorization:
   In a real production service, user authentication and authorization mechanisms should be implemented to secure endpoints that require access control. This is especially important for protecting the URL shortening and management functions.

2. Data Persistence:
   The current solution relies on in-memory storage (a JavaScript Map) for URL mappings. In production, it's crucial to use a persistent data store like MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or a key-value store like Redis for durability and scalability.

3. Rate Limiting and Abuse Prevention:
   To prevent abuse and potential attacks, rate limiting should be implemented on the URL shortening endpoint. This can help prevent excessive requests from a single IP address.

4. Validating and Sanitizing User Input:
   Input validation and sanitization are essential to protect against security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS). In a production service, input should be thoroughly validated and sanitized.

5. Error Handling and Logging:
   While error handling is present in the provided solution, production-grade error handling should include comprehensive logging and monitoring for easier troubleshooting and issue detection.

6. Environment Configuration:
   Configuration management should be improved. Secrets and environment-specific configuration data should be managed securely, such as using environment variables or a configuration management tool.

7. HTTPS and Security Headers:
   To enhance security, the service should be accessible only over HTTPS. Additionally, the inclusion of security headers (e.g., Content Security Policy, X-Content-Type-Options) can help protect against various web vulnerabilities.

8. Scalability and Load Balancing:
   To handle increased traffic and ensure high availability, the service should be designed for scalability. Load balancing and auto-scaling can be implemented as necessary.

9. Data Validation and Sanitization:
   User-provided URLs should be validated to ensure they are well-formed and safe. They should also be sanitized to prevent potential security issues.

10. Expired Short URLs:
    Implement a mechanism to track and expire short URLs after a certain period to ensure that the service does not accumulate unused mappings over time.

11. Analytics and Reporting:
    In a production service, you might want to implement analytics and reporting to track URL usage, user engagement, and other metrics.

12. Backup and Disaster Recovery:
    Regularly backup the data store to ensure data recovery in case of failures or data loss.

13. Compliance and Legal Considerations:
    Depending on your jurisdiction and use case, you may need to consider legal and compliance requirements, such as GDPR, HIPAA, or other data protection regulations.

14. Testing:
    Implement a comprehensive testing strategy, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests, to ensure the stability and reliability of the service.

15. Documentation:
    Maintain detailed and up-to-date documentation for developers and operations teams, including API documentation, deployment instructions, and troubleshooting guides.
